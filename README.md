# FitnessWatch
I ordered the watch on Alibaba a while ago and it just got here so I've only just begun work on this. The idea/end goal is to have a watch that acts like a garmin or coros or wahoo fitness watch that will allow you to track an outdoor activity (run, bike, etc) and use the gps data collected to form a gpx file that can be uploaded to Strava, a social media site/app for athletes. As well as other basic fitness watch necessities like a step counter, total exercise time, and a history view that allows you to view your most recent activities that are stored on a tf/SD card.
